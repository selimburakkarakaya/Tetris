# Tetris

This JavaScript code runs a classic Tetris game in the browser. The playing field includes basic functions such as creating pieces, moving, rotating, collision control, game operation and score calculation.

How does it work?

1. When the game starts, a Tetris piece is created and displayed at the top.

2. The user moves the piece using the arrow keys, accelerates the piece with the down arrow key, and rotates the piece with the up arrow key.

3. The piece continues to fall until it collides with other pieces or the playing field.

4. When the collision occurs, the part is placed and a new part is created.

5. As each line is completed, that line is deleted and the player's score increases.
